# Easily download saved TikTok videos
A simple script I made on the fly yesterday to grab a few saved videos before the US gov removed TikTok

## Requirements
1. Your machine must be running at least version 3 of Python
2. The most recent version of yt-dlp package must be installed and can be downloaded [here](https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp/)

## Steps to Use Script
1. Clone the PY-DOWNLOAD directory
2. Downloaded your TikTok data as a JSON file
3. Create a new JSON file in this directory called `videos.json`
4. Copy the "Favorite Videos" object from your TikTok data json file and paste into your new videos.json file
5. If you want to download all the videos run the donwload_script.py or if you want to filter by hashtag run the filter_video_download.py script. Note: If you're running the filter_video_download script, add your hashtag to the target_hashtag variable.
